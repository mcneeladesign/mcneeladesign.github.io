This site is the online presence of Miller & Green hairdressing in North Sydney. This is a wonderful little business with a very high standard in everything they do.

Due to the high standard of the client I am happy I was able to please them and meet the standard they set.

This project was completed solely by me, from consultation through to deployment and updates. 

The main focus of the client was to have a professional looking online presence and bring more business through the doors.
